The **ACME Coffee Shop is a fictituous store which sells coffee, beverages, ice cream, cookies and many other products**. 

Clients use an Android Application to place orders and perform payment. Later they go to the counter of the store and present a generated QR Code to pick up their order.
Coffe shop employees use a different application to scan and complete clients order.
